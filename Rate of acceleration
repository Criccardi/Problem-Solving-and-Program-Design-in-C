*****	The Software Development Method *****

1. Problem Requirements: To writea computer program that calculates the 
	cyclist's constant rate of acceleration and determines how long the 
	cyclist will take to come to rest.
2. Inputs: Time, Final Velocity, and Initial Velocity. Outputs: Acceleration
3. Algorithm:
	 - Retrieve and store the data
	 - Perform the computations
	 - Output the results
4. Defined and commented in program
5. Verified
