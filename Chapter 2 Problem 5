/* Hospitals use programmable pumps to deliver medications and fluids to intravenous
lines at a set number of milliliters per hour. Write a program to output
information for the labels the hospital pharmacy places on bags of I.V. medications
indicating the volume of medication to be infused and the rate at which the
pump should be set. The program should prompt the user to enter the quantity
of fluid in the bag and the number of minutes over which it should be infused.
Output the VTBI (volume to be infused) in ml and the infusion rate in ml/hr.
Sample run:
Volume to be infused (ml) => 100
Minutes over which to infuse => 20
VTBI: 100 ml
Rate: 300 ml/hr
